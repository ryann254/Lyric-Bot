# Lyric-Bot
The lyric bot runs a script that gets you the lryics to any song that you provided and shows you the most repeated words in that song.
And by most repeated words I mean words that are more than three letters long therefore excluding words like 'I' or 'I'm'.
It sources these lyrics from two websites whereby if it doesn't find the lyrics in one website in moves on to the other one.

This is a simple script though as it only looks at the first result on the website after doing a search.

# Usage
If you want to use this script then simply git clone it and install the following dependecies:
Selenium
Webdriver(you'll have to download this one manually. Here's the link...https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home, choose the latest update and then download it)
